**2024-04-27-v1** - Set the number pagination submenu to fixed width and aligned to center with flexbox.  

**2024-04-21-v1** - Moved the display of variable values to a popup.  Leaving notifications on main ui, will use that instead of popup notifications.  

**2024-04-21-v5** - White, cleaned up version of of the app, ready for adding downloads, displaying list of downloads features.  

**2024-04-21-v4** - Pseudo pop-ups are working but cannot get variables and notifications in just yet.  Tar before cleanup.

**2024-04-21-v2** - Letter ui pagination and button ui pagination visual state representation is done now. Tar before cleanup of tests causes damage.

**2024-04-15-v2** - Slightly cleaned up version with a working submenu.  This version requires rework of the of the query function, it is too primitive currently.

**2024-04-15-v1** - Taking a backup just in case.  

**2024-04-14-v1** - Per letter sorting works, sorting by number per page works, pagination buttons render out but they do not have a proper query attached yet.
